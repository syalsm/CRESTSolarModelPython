# CRESTSolarModelPython

This model is a rewritten version of the NREL CREST solar cost model (see https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/crest.html for more information). The model is originally built in Microsoft Excel. This model has many assumptions associated with the model architecture, all of which are listed in the code.
